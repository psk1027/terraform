terraform day-1 [18-11-2024] monday

summary:
docker & k8s , terraform migration 
* duration of devops terraform tool = 6weeks
* mon-fri 9 pm to 11 pm

* aws = cloudformation
* azure = arm templating
* packer = 8sessions
* 2 to 3 projects 
terraform + jenkins ,github actions ,gitlab


* infrastructure as a code (iac) ?

* 1=> iac tools pulumi

doubt = application servers tomcat

benefits:
cost reduction
on top of os runtime appache tomcat on top we install app


* **INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE:(IAC)**

* WHAT IS INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE?
* WHY WE NEED TO CREATE INFRASTRUCTURE ?

* WHENEVER DEVLPR DEVLPS THE APPLICATION HE NEEDS JAVA JRE TO DEVELOP APP , THEY NEED PLATFORM LINUX OS ,TOMCAT APPLICATION SERVER, IDE,BUILD TOOL , PACKAGE NEED TO DEPLOY IN APPLICATION SERVER THESE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE NEED

* WE NEED TO SETUP THE HARDWARE , OS REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT ON TOP WE RUN APP

* INFRA__-
* 1. SERVERS
* 2. STORAGES
* 3. NETWORKS
* 4. FIREWALLS
* 5. LOAD BALANCERS
* 6. DATABASES
* 7. AKS,EKS, DOCKER

YOU CAN DO IT WITH MANUALLY YOU CREATE INFRASTRUCTURE
* 1. TIME CONSUMING
* 2. EXPERT
* 3. ERRORS
* 4. TROUBLESHOOTING

* INDUSTRY DOING AUTOMATION SCRIPT LIKE POWERSHELL,SHELL   SCRIPT,PYTHON LOT OF ERRORS , ISSUES HANDLING INFRA
WHO EVER WRITE SCRIPT CAREFULLY , VERIFY EACH AND EVERY STEP
SOMETIMES FAILS BY DOING PROGRAMMING AS WELL

WHICH CAN FASTLY CREATE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE

HUMAN INTERVENTION IS LESS WE WILL PROVIDE TEMPLATES AS AN INPUT WE CAN CALL CONFIG OR TEMPLATE FILES
BY USING TEMPLATE WE CREATE INFRA

AWS/AZURE/GCP
CONSOLE LOGIN RESOURCES CREATED THROUGH MANUALLY INTERVENTION /MIGHT BE ERROR = THROUGH GUI /CMD LINE UTILITY

IAC TOOLS : TERRAFORM ,PULUMI

WITH THE HELP OF IAC TOOL IT HAS THE TEMPLATES WHICH CONTAINS INFRA SPECIFICATIONS , EASY TO MANAGE AND EDIT AND DISTRIBUTE CONFIG TO OTHER TEAMS

DATA ,FILE FORMATS SETTING TEMPLATES ,
* HCL LANGUAGE
* SETUP ENVI FOR DEV CREATE /GENERATE 
* TERRAFORM DOCUMENTATION IS VERY IMP

**BENEFITS:**
* 1. COST REDUCTION
* 2. INCREASE IN SPEED OF DEPLOYMENT
* 3. REDUCE HUMAN ERRORS/INTERVENTION
* 4. IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE CONSISTENCY(IDEMPOTENT) SAME OUTPUT /SOMETIME MISMATCH
* 5. ELIMINATE THE CONFIGUG DRIFTS


FOR EXAMPLE: DEVLPR DEVLPS THE APP AND DEPLOYMNT REQ RESOURCES
VM /OS/JAVA11 JRE/APACHE TOMCAT SERVER APP SERVER 11.7/RUNTIME/DEPENDENCY/ON TOP APP LIKE AMAZON VERSION 1.0
APP 2.0
JAVA 17
CONFIG CHANGES/UPGRADE THE APP FOR VERSION 2 NOW AGAIN 3
revert back to older changes is tedious task, time consuming,
how did wht changes how track of it, 
drift from somebody keep track of it
 teraform maintains state file timestamp how did the changes on which files it maintain 
simple easy ,it can manage the versioning
app=github 
github managing thee versioning
diff config of software or managing documentation it will be time consuming
